Objectives:
Our objective was to create a virtual environment on a server and then create a virtual machine running windows server using a disk. 
Equipment List:
Dell server
DVD for installing ProxMox VE
Brower to connect to the virtual environment
ISO file of Window server to install VM
Remote desktop to access WinServer 2016
Notes and Observations:
	Day 1: 2/04/2020
We went to install ProxMox installer and one of our hardware did not turn on. 
ProxMox	Hostname	Hyper 4 Info
Pw: cmst;315	hyper4.labs.salina.edu	IP Address: 10.136.212.45
Email: alexan49@ksu.edu
	Netmask: 255.255.252.0
Username: root		Gateway: 10.136.212.1
		DNS Server: 10.133.253.130
Virtualization platform started creating partition. Full virtualization (KVM) started running unmodified virtual servers by Linux or windows. Could not be installed we had to reboot twice. 
	Day 2: 2/06/2020
Turned on Dell rack and got rid of foreign configuration. Raid level was zero. We initialized under virtual disk management.
https://10.136.212.45:8006
We typed that into our browser to make sure our dell disk we connected was working and it worked. 
	Day 3: 2/10/2020
We turned on computer and immediately went on WinSCP and moved windows into our IP Address template that will be creating a virtual machine. 
General	OS	H-Disk	Sockets	Memory
Node: hyper4	Local	Disk size: 40 GB	Cores: 4	8,192
VM ID: 100	Windows			
Name: WinServer4				
On the chart above is what we changed from our CPU settings. From there we clicked start went to console and no VNC and from there it started running. We custom installed our own windows and finished programming. 
IP Address: 10.136.212.54
Netmask: 255.255.252.0
Gateway: 10.136.212.1
10.133.252.130
10.133.252.131
References: No references. 
Questions:
3.	10.136.212.54
4.	255.255.252.0
5.	10.133.252.131
6.	10.136.212.45 to 10.136.212.54
7.	The Default Gateway is an internet protocol that serves as a host to other networks when there are no IP Addresses.
8.	There would be no WIFI connected to my server so no connection to the Ethernet at all. 
Conclusion and Reflection:
It was a nice lab really cool to find out how to create a virtual machine from the start from having nothing to having your own virtual machine which is how Windows got started.
